If we pivot into Moodle and start adding (more? we should eval the use of the PDF exercises as they muddle the message) 
curator-specific activities that move into different types of courses, aren't we then just de facto creating new 
entirely new courses? How are these courses different than any other course type that we're creating? It's the same pedgogy,
just with an emphasis placed upon external resources? But the courses we create already leverage external resources.
Having custom content almost defeats the purpose of this thing and creates confusion as to what the platform is.
We curate links. Period. The actual content is _out there_; the curator _just points to stuff_ and tells you why
--in context of the pathway--it helps you achieve the goal. There should be no more to this and it should be 
clearly branded and communicated that this is the case.


What if we just didn't track user progress?
What if we track it, but only track it on-device? localstorage
JOIN A WORKING GROUP needs to be prominently displayed and invite each
EXPOSE CURATORS we need to put faces to these working groups?? Why not???


Curator CMS lives on Kepler (or similar--even Spitzer), segrated to just curators, and there's a build process 
that outputs a static version of _just the content_ 
Within the static output, javascript is added to talk to a user info API that handles pathway follows, 
activity claims, and bookmarks?

-[] Fork learning-curator into curator-cms
-[] curator-ta built on Mongo/Express/NodeJS/TypeScript API for just user info
-[] investigate redoing Curator CMS in Python/Django?
