If we pivot into Moodle and start adding (more? we should eval the use of the PDF exercises as they muddle the message) 
curator-specific activities that move into different types of courses, aren't we then just de facto creating new 
entirely new courses? How are these courses different than any other course type that we're creating? It's the same pedgogy,
just with an emphasis placed upon external resources? But the courses we create already leverage external resources.
Having custom content almost defeats the purpose of this thing and creates confusion as to what the platform is.
We curate links. Period. The actual content is _out there_; the curator _just points to stuff_ and tells you why
--in context of the pathway--it helps you achieve the goal. There should be no more to this and it should be 
clearly branded and communicated that this is the case.


What if we just didn't track user progress?
What if we track it, but only track it on-device? localstorage
JOIN A WORKING GROUP needs to be prominently displayed and invite each
EXPOSE CURATORS we need to put faces to these working groups?? Why not???


Curator CMS lives on Kepler (or similar--even Spitzer), segrated to just curators, and there's a build process 
that outputs a static version of _just the content_ 
Within the static output, javascript is added to talk to a user info API that handles pathway follows, 
activity claims, and bookmarks?

-[] Fork learning-curator into curator-cms
-[] curator-ta built on Mongo/Express/NodeJS/TypeScript API for just user info
-[] investigate redoing Curator CMS in Python/Django?

FOLLOW A PATHWAY
    By following a pathway, you begin to track your progress as you step through it
CLAIM ACTIVITIES
    By claiming required activities you complete the steps and fill in the rings
BECOME A CURATOR
    Pathways are organized by topic; Curators are immersed in it and collaborating on pathways


Curators
Pathways are organized by topic; Curators are immersed in that topic; they've been to the conferences, taken the courses, read the books, and consumed many hours of content; they are already aware of the big names and terminology; they are able to compare and contrast these aspects; it's their passion. When great new resources pop up somewhere, or perhaps some watershed moment happens and all the old information is wrong? Our Curators are often the first to know. When multiple Curators collaborate, they are able to create pathways which have defined goals and a clear progression from start-to-end, using only the most relevant and high-quality resources available. Pathways are organic in nature, changing over time to allow for growth and pruning; rearranging and correcting; collaborated upon with other Curators, with help from you!
